Description:
We plan to build a microblogging service similar to Twitter.
The project has two RESTful back-end microservices: users and timeines.
Each user has a username, email address, password, and list of users that the user is following. Users can post messages.
Each post has the author's username, text of post, and a timestamp when it was created.
Messages are aggregated into timelines. There are three different timelines:
   1. User timeline for posts the user has made
   2. Home timeline for recent posts by all users that the user follows
   3. Public timeline for all posts from all users
Timelines are organized in reverse chronological order. They are limited to 25 per web service.
